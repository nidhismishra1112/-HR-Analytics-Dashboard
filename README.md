 Title: HR Analytics Dashboard: Power BI Project for Employee Performance and Retention

Description:

The HR Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to help organizations improve employee performance and reduce attrition by gaining valuable insights from HR data. The objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive and visually appealing dashboard that empowers HR professionals with data-driven insights to optimize their HR strategies and initiatives.

The project begins by importing HR data from various sources, such as employee records, performance evaluations, training data, and attrition data, into Power BI. The data is then transformed and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency. Data cleaning techniques, such as handling missing values, data validation, and data formatting, are applied to ensure high data quality for analysis.

Next, the data is analyzed using various key performance indicators (KPIs) that are relevant to employee performance and retention. KPIs may include metrics such as employee turnover rate, average performance ratings, training completion rates, employee engagement scores, and other relevant HR metrics. These KPIs are calculated and visualized using Power BI's interactive and dynamic visualization tools, such as bar charts, line charts, cards, tree, slicer to provide a comprehensive overview of the HR performance landscape.

The dashboard also include interactive elements, such as filters, slicers, and drill-down functionalities, to allow HR professionals to explore the data and gain deeper insights. For example, HR professionals can filter the data by department, job level, or performance rating to identify patterns and trends in employee performance and attrition. This enables HR professionals to pinpoint areas that need improvement and take proactive measures to enhance employee performance and reduce attrition.

Furthermore, advanced analytics techniques, such as data modeling, data forecasting, and sentiment analysis, may be employed to gain deeper insights into employee behavior and sentiment. For example, data forecasting can be used to predict future attrition rates based on historical data, and sentiment analysis can be used to analyze employee feedback and comments to identify potential areas of concern or improvement.

The final outcome of the project is a comprehensive HR analytics dashboard that provides HR professionals with actionable insights and recommendations to optimize their HR strategies and initiatives. The dashboard empowers HR professionals to make data-driven decisions to improve employee performance, reduce attrition, and enhance overall employee retention. This Power BI project showcases my expertise in data analysis, visualization, and advanced analytics, utilizing Power BI's powerful functionalities to create impactful HR analytics dashboards for strategic HR decision-making.
